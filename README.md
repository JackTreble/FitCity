# FitCity
FitCity was a small demo hacked together for the Bristol Open Data Challenge 6,

The basic concept was a platform users could connect their fitness apps (Google Fit, Apple health, fitbit etc) to, the user would then set the area of Bristol they live, the collected fitness data would contribute points to their area.
This would gamify fitness in Bristol by incentivising walking, running, cycling and public transport so the user could collect points for their team.
